#Simblog

Welcome to SimBlog! A very simple and easy to configure blogging platform.

The main objectives of this blogging platform are:
* **Simple**
* Extendable
* Ease of use - workflow emphasized
* Elegance
* Visually stunning

**Web Site**: http://www.simblog.org
**FreeCode**: https://freecode.com/projects/simblog

This project is still in alpha stage. I'm currently in the process of updating
the template with one I made myself and also cleaning up the code and refactoring
it.

Some technologies or libraries we're using:

* Smarty templateing engine for PHP
* idiorm PDO class for databases
* Extensive use of AJAX
* jQuery and Kendo UI

If you would like to contribute to this project please go to the project's issue
tracker and pick a bug :).

Welcome to SimBlog! A very simple and easy to configure blogging platform.

As of now (5 February 2012) this application is in Alpha developement stage.
The core features work (with minor bugs or incompleteness) which are:
* Admin log-in
* Posts manipulation: create, modify, delete
* Comments: add, delete by admin

Some technologies or libraries we're using:
* Smarty templateing engine for PHP
* idiorm PDO class for databases
* Extensive use of AJAX
* jQuery and jQuery UI (in the future)

If you would like to contribute to this project please go to the project's wiki
and see what the bug trackers says.

In major lines I would like to point what this application needs improving (or
implementing):

* HTML control buttons and functions (JavaScript with jQuery [UI])
* Admin dashboard (a more centralised and all-in-one page for admins to manage
their blog posts and comments, categories and so forth)
* A better design :), Simblog is currently using a downloaded HTML/CSS template
modified by me.
